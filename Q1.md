i) Constant Time - This is where time remains constant regardless of the size input. e.g Accessing an elementin an arrya by an index.

ii) Logarithmic Time - The excution time grows logarithmically as input increases. e.g Binary search in a sorted array.

iii) Quadratic Time - Execution time grows exponemtially as input size grows. e.g Nested Loops in Bubble sort algorithms.

iv) Exponetial Time - The execution time doubles with each input element. e.g Reursive Fibonacci claculation.

v) Linear Time - The execution time increase proportionally to the input size. e.g Traversing an array.
