i) Memory Allloction.
Arrrays are in a contiguous block in the memory thus needs a predefined size. Linked Lists are dynamically allocated hence their size can change.

ii) Performance.
Linked Lists have slow access (0(n)) thus they must traverse nodes. Arrays have faster element access using indexing (0(n)) than Linked Lists.

iii) Insretion and Deletion.
Arrays are costly(0(n)) as elements may need to shift from time to time. Linked Lists are more efficient at head/tail, but are slower in middle(0(n)).
